# ZenPhone

*An accessible Android launcher for older adults and people with visual or motor impairments.*

ZenPhone replaces the phone's interface with a larger, simpler and friendlier one. It is free
and open source, and it stands on the shoulders of two earlier projects: the original
[BaldPhone](https://github.com/UriahShaulMandel/BaldPhone) by Uriah Shaul Mandel, and its
modernized continuation [BaldPhone Neo](https://github.com/DamianKuzmiak/BaldPhoneNeo) by
Damian Kuzmiak.

ZenPhone is an independent fork with its own roadmap. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by
the upstream authors.

## Features

- Home launcher with large, high-contrast targets
- Dialer and contacts designed for shaky hands and poor eyesight
- Alarms and medication reminders
- SOS button
- Photo and video viewer
- Simplified keyboard
- Notification management
- Available in 38 languages

## Status

Early stage. The project inherits an in-progress migration from Java to Kotlin — roughly half
the codebase has been converted so far — along with a modernized Android toolchain.

Current priorities:

1. Restore full-screen alarms on Android 14+
2. Raise `targetSdk` to 35, then 36
3. Continuous integration
4. Continue the Kotlin migration

## Building

Requirements: a recent Android Studio (the project uses AGP 9.1.1 and Gradle 9.4.1),
JDK 17 or newer, and Android SDK platforms 35 and 36.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zenolabs/ZenPhone.git
cd ZenPhone
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat`, and make sure `JAVA_HOME` points at a JDK 17+ installation —
the runtime bundled with Android Studio, under `<install dir>\jbr`, works fine.

## Installation

No releases yet. Distribution will target F-Droid and direct APK downloads.

Note that Google Play policies restrict apps requesting several system-level permissions at
once (call log, contacts, media). Publishing there would require splitting the app or dropping
core functionality, so it is not currently planned.
